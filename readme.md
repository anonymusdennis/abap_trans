# Useful Abap Transactions
Accessible [HERE](https://anonymusdennis.github.io/abap_trans/abap%20trans.html).

I decided to add this page because when learning abap i realized, that SAP has so many Functions and Transactions (most of them useful) that it is near impossible to learn them all,
this is why i decided to make this repo, 
I plan on adding more Features as time goes on, but if you have any suggestions on things to add / change: the usual: make a pull request or a new issue.
